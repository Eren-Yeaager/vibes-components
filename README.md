Proof of Vibes components on BOS

## Getting Started 

```
npm install
```

Then, run the command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will serve the widgets from `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`.

Go to [everything.dev/flags](https://everything.dev/flags) or [near.org/flags](https://near.org/flags) and paste this value there.

Once set, see the locally served app at [bos.proofofvibes.near/widget/test](https://everything.dev/bos.proofofvibes.near/widget/test).
